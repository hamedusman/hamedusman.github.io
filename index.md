<div class="summary"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The study reaffirms that the fundamentals of the supply chain relationships have not changed during the digital transformation period in Korea between 2006 and 2018. The supply chain professionals in 2006 regarded trust building process as the most important construct for the successful supply chain operations while in the 2018, trust-based commitment became the most important construct.

<li>Product A Delivery Cost Reduction · Novus International</li>
<div class="summary"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> <a href="http://www.novusint.com">Novus International</a> delivered 3M lbs of Product A in 2018, with a total of 95,000 miles driven to make the deliveries. The contracted cost of mileage increased in 2019, making it more essential to reduce the overall mileage needed to deliver the product and study the delivery cost from current distribution point with the goal of determining the placement of a secondary distribution location to reduce the cost.</p></div>

<li>Managing Donated Goods Inventory · International Institute of Saint Louis</li>
<div class="summary"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> <a href="https://www.iistl.org">International Institute of Saint Louis</a> receives donations from several sources and purchases the items which don’t come as donated goods.
